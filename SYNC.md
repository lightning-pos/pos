## Architecture Overview

The system uses a hybrid architecture with a central hub:

- **Local SQLite Database**: Each POS instance has its own local SQLite database
- **Cloud SQLite Database**: Each POS instance syncs with its cloud SQLite database
- **Central Hub Database**: Consolidates data from all shops and serves as the primary source of truth
- **ETL Sync Service**: Manages data flow between shop cloud databases and the central hub

### Data Flow

1. **Catalog Data Flow**:
   - Central Database → ETL Service → Cloud SQLite → POS Instance
   - POS Instance → Cloud SQLite → ETL Service → Central Database → ETL Service → Other Cloud SQLites → Other POS Instances

2. **Sales Data Flow**:
   - POS Instance → Cloud SQLite → ETL Service → Central Database (for aggregation)
   - Sales data does NOT sync between different shops

### Technology Stack

- **Database**: SQLite (local) and Turso (cloud)
- **Sync Mechanism**: Turso's offline writes feature using SQLite's WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
- **ETL Service**: Rust-based service for cross-database synchronization
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri
- **Frontend**: Next.js

## Implementation Details

### Backend Integration (Rust/Tauri)

#### Backend Components

```
# Dependencies
Add libsql with sync feature to Cargo.toml

# AppService Structure
AppService {
    db: Database,                    // Turso/libSQL database
    conn: Connection,                // Database connection
    state: SessionState,             // Current session state
    shop_id: String,                 // Current shop identifier
    hub_sync_config: SyncConfig      // Sync configuration
}

# Initialize AppService
function initialize_app_service(db_path, shop_id, sync_url, auth_token, is_hub):
    if sync_url and auth_token exist:
        configure database with sync options
    else:
        open database without sync

    return AppService instance

# Sync with Schema Check
function sync_with_schema_check():
    local_version = get local schema version
    central_version = get central schema version

    if local_version < central_version:
        return error "Schema version mismatch, update required"

    perform sync
    return success
```

#### Command Implementation

```
# Create Sales Order with Shop ID
function create_sales_order(order_data):
    begin transaction
        create new order with shop_id
        insert order into database
        update sync metadata with pending status
    commit transaction
    return order
```

### Frontend Integration (Next.js)

#### Frontend Components

```
# Sync Status Component
function SyncStatus():
    state:
        syncStatus: 'online' | 'offline' | 'syncing'
        lastSynced: timestamp or null
        needsUpdate: boolean
        errorMessage: string

    # Monitor online status
    listen for online/offline events

    # Manual sync function
    function triggerSync():
        set status to syncing
        try:
            invoke backend sync
            update lastSynced timestamp
            show success notification
        catch error:
            if error is schema mismatch:
                show update required message
            else:
                show error notification

    # Auto-sync when coming online
    when syncStatus changes to online:
        trigger sync

    # Render appropriate UI based on state
    render sync status indicator, last sync time, and sync button
```

#### Background Sync Service

```
# Background Sync Service
function startSyncService():
    set sync interval to 5 minutes

    perform initial sync

    set up periodic sync timer

    add focus event listener to sync when app regains focus

    return cleanup function

function performSync():
    if online:
        try to sync with database
```

## Multi-Shop Synchronization

### Database Schema Modifications

```
# Add shop identification to tables
1. Add shop_id to shop-specific tables:
   - sales_orders
   - sales_order_items
   - sales_order_payments
   - expenses
   - etc.

2. Add tracking columns to shared catalog tables:
   - origin_shop_id: shop that created the record
   - last_modified_shop_id: shop that last modified the record
   - last_modified_at: timestamp of last modification

3. Create sync metadata table:
   - table_name: which table the record belongs to
   - record_id: unique identifier of the record
   - shop_id: shop that owns/modified the record
   - sync_status: pending, synced, or conflict

4. Create shop configuration table:
   - id: unique shop identifier
   - name: shop name
   - sync_url: URL for cloud sync
   - is_active: whether shop is active
```

### Shop-Specific Queries

```
# Get Sales Orders for Current Shop
function get_sales_orders(limit, offset):
    query sales_orders table
    filter by current shop_id
    order by created_at descending
    apply limit and offset
    return filtered orders
```

### Initial Shop Setup

```
# Provision New Shop
function provision_new_shop(shop_name, hub_url, auth_token):
    generate unique shop_id
    create new database file
    initialize schema
    insert shop record
    perform initial sync to get catalog data
    return shop_id
```

### Shop Identity and Cloud Database Mapping

A critical aspect of the multi-shop architecture is how each local SQLite instance identifies and connects to its corresponding cloud instance. This section details the mechanisms that ensure each shop connects to the correct cloud database.

#### Shop Identity Establishment

```
# Shop Identity Establishment
function establish_shop_identity():
    # Check if shop identity exists in local storage
    shop_config = get_shop_config_from_local_db()

    if shop_config exists:
        return shop_config
    else:
        # First-time setup flow
        if is_new_shop_setup():
            # Create new shop identity
            shop_id = generate_unique_shop_id()
            shop_name = prompt_for_shop_name()

            # Register with central hub to get cloud database URL
            registration_result = register_shop_with_hub(shop_id, shop_name)
            cloud_db_url = registration_result.cloud_db_url
            auth_token = registration_result.auth_token
        else:
            # Existing shop connection flow
            shop_id = prompt_for_shop_id()
            auth_credentials = authenticate_shop(shop_id)
            cloud_db_url = auth_credentials.cloud_db_url
            auth_token = auth_credentials.auth_token
            shop_name = auth_credentials.shop_name

        # Store shop configuration locally
        shop_config = {
            id: shop_id,
            name: shop_name,
            sync_url: cloud_db_url,
            auth_token: auth_token,
            is_active: true
        }

        save_shop_config_to_local_db(shop_config)
        securely_store_auth_token(shop_id, auth_token)

        return shop_config
```

#### Cloud Database Provisioning

When a new shop is registered, the central hub provisions a dedicated cloud database instance for that shop:

```
# Cloud Database Provisioning (Hub-side)
function provision_cloud_database_for_shop(shop_id, shop_name):
    # Create a new Turso database instance for this shop
    db_name = generate_db_name_from_shop_id(shop_id)
    cloud_db = create_turso_database(db_name)

    # Generate unique authentication token for this shop
    auth_token = generate_secure_token()

    # Store mapping between shop_id and cloud database
    store_shop_db_mapping(shop_id, cloud_db.url, auth_token)

    # Initialize database schema
    initialize_db_schema(cloud_db)

    # Populate with initial catalog data
    populate_initial_catalog(cloud_db)

    return {
        cloud_db_url: cloud_db.url,
        auth_token: auth_token
    }
```

#### Persistent Shop Identity

The shop identity is persisted across application restarts:

```
# Application Startup
function initialize_app():
    # Load shop identity from local storage
    shop_config = get_shop_config_from_local_db()

    if not shop_config:
        # First-time setup or recovery needed
        shop_config = establish_shop_identity()

    # Retrieve auth token from secure storage
    auth_token = securely_retrieve_auth_token(shop_config.id)

    # Initialize app service with shop identity and sync configuration
    app_service = initialize_app_service(
        db_path: "local.db",
        shop_id: shop_config.id,
        sync_url: shop_config.sync_url,
        auth_token: auth_token,
        is_hub: false
    )

    return app_service
```

#### Authentication and Verification

During sync operations, the shop identity is verified to ensure security:

```
# Shop Identity Verification During Sync
function verify_shop_identity_during_sync(shop_id, auth_token, cloud_db_url):
    # Send authentication request to cloud database
    auth_result = send_auth_request(cloud_db_url, shop_id, auth_token)

    if auth_result.success:
        # Proceed with sync
        return true
    else:
        # Authentication failed
        log_auth_failure(auth_result.error)
        notify_user_of_auth_issue()
        return false
```

#### Recovery Procedures

If a shop loses its identity or connection information, recovery procedures are available:

```
# Shop Identity Recovery
function recover_shop_identity(recovery_code):
    # Validate recovery code with central hub
    recovery_result = validate_recovery_code(recovery_code)

    if recovery_result.valid:
        # Restore shop configuration
        shop_config = {
            id: recovery_result.shop_id,
            name: recovery_result.shop_name,
            sync_url: recovery_result.cloud_db_url,
            is_active: true
        }

        save_shop_config_to_local_db(shop_config)
        securely_store_auth_token(shop_config.id, recovery_result.auth_token)

        return shop_config
    else:
        throw "Invalid recovery code"
```

### Multiple POS Instances Within a Single Shop

For shops with multiple POS instances, we need a strategy to ensure all instances stay synchronized with each other and with the cloud. This section outlines three approaches with their respective advantages and implementation considerations.

#### Approach 1: Local Server as Shop Hub

In this approach, a dedicated local server acts as the central hub for all POS instances within the shop.

```
# Local Server Hub Architecture
1. Local Server:
   - Runs a dedicated sync service
   - Maintains the master local database
   - Handles all cloud synchronization
   - Provides a local API for POS instances

2. POS Instances:
   - Connect to the local server via local network
   - Perform all database operations through the local server
   - Do not directly connect to the cloud

# Local Server Sync Process
function local_server_sync():
    # Sync with cloud on a schedule
    schedule_periodic_task(sync_with_cloud, interval=5_minutes)

    # Listen for POS instance connections
    start_local_api_server()

    # Handle requests from POS instances
    function handle_pos_request(request):
        if request.type == "query":
            return query_local_database(request.query)
        elif request.type == "transaction":
            result = apply_transaction_to_local_db(request.transaction)
            mark_for_cloud_sync(request.transaction)
            return result
```

**Advantages:**
- Centralized management within the shop
- Single point of sync with the cloud, reducing bandwidth and potential conflicts
- Can serve as a local backup
- Simplified identity management (only the server needs cloud credentials)

**Disadvantages:**
- Additional hardware/software to maintain
- Single point of failure within the shop
- More complex setup for small businesses
- May require IT expertise to manage

**Recommended for:** Larger shops with IT support, high transaction volumes, or many POS instances.

#### Approach 2: Leader Election Among POS Instances

In this approach, one POS instance is dynamically elected as the leader responsible for cloud synchronization.

```
# Leader Election Process
function start_leader_election():
    # Broadcast leadership candidacy to other instances
    broadcast_message({
        type: "leader_candidacy",
        instance_id: current_instance_id,
        priority: calculate_instance_priority()
    })

    # Wait for responses or timeout
    responses = collect_responses(timeout=5_seconds)

    if all responses accept candidacy:
        become_leader()
    else:
        follow_elected_leader(highest_priority_instance)

# Leader Responsibilities
function leader_responsibilities():
    # Sync with cloud
    schedule_periodic_task(sync_with_cloud, interval=5_minutes)

    # Accept sync requests from follower instances
    listen_for_follower_sync_requests()

    # Broadcast important updates to followers
    function broadcast_update(update):
        for each follower in active_followers:
            send_update(follower, update)

# Follower Responsibilities
function follower_responsibilities():
    # Send local changes to leader
    when local_database_changes_occur():
        send_changes_to_leader()

    # Monitor leader health
    schedule_periodic_task(check_leader_health, interval=30_seconds)

    # Initiate new election if leader fails
    function check_leader_health():
        if not leader_responds_to_ping():
            start_leader_election()
```

**Advantages:**
- No additional hardware required
- Automatic failover if the leader goes offline
- More resilient to failures
- Simpler setup for small businesses

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex implementation (leader election, failover mechanisms)
- Potential for split-brain scenarios if network partitions occur
- All POS instances need cloud credentials
- May have higher latency for sync operations

**Recommended for:** Medium-sized shops with multiple POS instances but without dedicated IT infrastructure.

#### Approach 3: Direct Cloud Sync with Local P2P Communication

In this approach, each POS instance syncs directly with the cloud but also communicates with other instances over the local network for immediate data sharing.

```
# Direct Cloud Sync with P2P
function initialize_pos_instance():
    # Set up cloud sync
    configure_cloud_sync(shop_id, auth_token)
    schedule_periodic_task(sync_with_cloud, interval=5_minutes)

    # Set up local peer discovery
    start_peer_discovery_service()

    # When peers are discovered, establish connections
    function on_peer_discovered(peer):
        establish_p2p_connection(peer)

    # Share important updates immediately with peers
    function on_local_important_update(update):
        sync_with_cloud()  # Try immediate cloud sync
        broadcast_to_peers(update)  # Share with peers regardless of cloud sync success

    # Receive updates from peers
    function on_peer_update(update):
        apply_update_to_local_db(update)
        # Don't sync this to cloud as the originating peer will do that
```

**Advantages:**
- No single point of failure
- Real-time data sharing between POS instances
- No leader election complexity
- Works even if internet connection is down (for local operations)

**Disadvantages:**
- Multiple connections to the cloud database
- Potential for conflicts if multiple instances modify the same data
- More complex conflict resolution
- Higher bandwidth usage with the cloud

**Recommended for:** Small to medium shops with just a few POS instances, or shops with unreliable internet connectivity.

#### Implementation Considerations

1. **Instance Identification:**
   - Each POS instance needs a unique identifier within the shop
   - All instances share the same shop_id but have different instance_ids

2. **Data Partitioning:**
   - Some data (like open orders) may be instance-specific
   - Other data (like completed sales, inventory) must be shared across all instances

3. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Define clear rules for handling concurrent modifications
   - Consider timestamp-based resolution with instance priority as tiebreaker

4. **Network Resilience:**
   - All approaches should handle temporary network outages
   - Local operations should continue even when disconnected from other instances

5. **Security:**
   - Ensure secure communication between instances
   - Validate instance identity within the shop network

## Data Synchronization Service

A dedicated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service manages the data flow between shop cloud databases and the central hub database. This service is critical for maintaining data consistency across the entire system while respecting different sync rules for different data types.

### ETL Service Components

```
# ETL Service Architecture
1. Scheduler: Triggers sync jobs based on schedule or events
2. Extractor: Connects to databases and extracts changed data
3. Transformer: Applies business rules to the data
4. Loader: Writes transformed data to target database
5. Conflict Resolver: Handles data conflicts
6. Monitor: Tracks sync status and performance
```

### Sync Process Flow

```
# Shop to Central Hub Sync
function sync_shop_to_hub(shop_id):
    # Extract changes from shop's cloud database
    changes = extract_changes(shop_id, last_sync_time)

    for each record in changes:
        # Apply transformation rules based on data type
        if record.table is catalog_table:
            # Apply catalog-specific transformations
            transformed = transform_catalog_data(record)
            # Check for conflicts
            if conflict_exists(transformed):
                resolved = resolve_catalog_conflict(transformed, existing_record, is_hub=true)
                load_to_hub(resolved)
                mark_for_propagation(resolved)  # Will be synced to other shops
            else:
                load_to_hub(transformed)
                mark_for_propagation(transformed)
        else:  # Sales or shop-specific data
            # Apply shop-specific transformations
            transformed = transform_shop_data(record)
            load_to_hub(transformed)

    update_last_sync_time(shop_id)

# Central Hub to Shop Sync (for catalog data)
function sync_hub_to_shop(shop_id):
    # Get catalog changes that need propagation to this shop
    catalog_changes = get_pending_propagations(shop_id)

    for each record in catalog_changes:
        # Skip if this shop originated the change
        if record.origin_shop_id == shop_id:
            continue

        # Transform for shop consumption
        transformed = transform_for_shop(record)

        # Load to shop's cloud database
        load_to_shop_cloud(shop_id, transformed)

        # Mark as propagated to this shop
        mark_propagated(record.id, shop_id)
```

### Implementation Options

```
# ETL Service Implementation Options
1. Scheduled Service:
   - Runs on fixed intervals
   - Processes all pending changes
   - Good for predictable workloads

2. Event-Driven Service:
   - Triggered by database change events
   - Processes changes in near real-time
   - More responsive but more complex

3. Hybrid Approach:
   - Event notifications trigger sync jobs
   - Scheduled jobs catch any missed events
   - Combines responsiveness with reliability
```

## Schema Migration Strategy

We use an enforced schema update approach where clients must update their schema before syncing if there's a version mismatch.

### Schema Version Tracking

```
# Schema Version Table
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
)
```

### Version Check Before Sync

```
# Check Schema Version Before Sync
function sync_with_schema_check():
    local_version = get local schema version
    central_version = get central schema version

    if local_version < central_version:
        return error "Update required before sync"

    # Versions match, proceed with sync
    perform sync
    return success

function get_schema_version():
    ensure schema_version table exists
    query for highest version number
    return version or 0 if none found
```

### Schema Migration on Update

```
# Apply Schema Migrations
function apply_schema_migrations():
    current_version = get current schema version
    target_version = version for this application release

    if current_version < target_version:
        begin transaction
            # Apply migrations sequentially
            if current_version < 1:
                add shop_id to sales_orders

            if current_version < 2:
                add tracking columns to items

            # Update schema version
            update schema_version table
        commit transaction

        log "Schema updated from version X to Y"
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

```
# Resolve Catalog Conflicts
function resolve_catalog_conflict(local_item, remote_item, is_hub):
    if is_hub:
        # Hub always wins in conflicts
        return remote_item
    else:
        # For shop instances, use timestamp-based resolution
        if local_item.last_modified_at > remote_item.last_modified_at:
            return local_item
        else:
            return remote_item
```

### Sync with Conflict Resolution

```
# Sync with Conflict Resolution
function sync_with_conflict_resolution():
    try:
        perform sync
        return success
    catch SyncConflict:
        log "Conflict detected, attempting to resolve"

        # Try to resolve with rebase strategy
        set sync options with rebase strategy
        retry sync with new options
        return success
    catch other errors:
        return error
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

```
# Validate Shop Access
function validate_shop_access(service, record_shop_id):
    # Only allow access if:
    # 1. Record belongs to current shop, or
    # 2. Current instance is the hub
    if service.shop_id != record_shop_id and not service.is_hub:
        return AccessDeniedError
    return success
```

### Secure Sync Configuration

Store sync credentials securely and use HTTPS for all sync communications.

```
# Get Secure Sync Credentials
function get_sync_credentials():
    # Use OS keychain or secure storage
    url = keychain.get_password("app_name", "sync_url")
    token = keychain.get_password("app_name", "sync_token")
    return (url, token)
```
