Naming Conventions - TypeScript (src-ui)
- Use camelCase for variable names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for folder names (eg. src-ui)

Make best developer experience and end user experience a priority.

Make everything type safe whenever possible and utilize best practices for not repeating ourselves.
