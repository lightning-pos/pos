Code Style and Guidelines (General)
- Use functional and declarative patterns. Avoid using classes.
- Use hexagonal (ports and adapter) architecture for a clean code base.

Naming Conventions - TypeScript (src-ui)
- Use camelCase for variable names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for folder names (eg. src-ui)
- Use snake_case for file names

UI Styling
- Use carbon for ui components
- Use tailwind for styling and layout adjustments
- Implement responsive design using tailwind css

Make best developer experience and end user experience a priority.

Make everything type safe whenever possible and utilize best practices for not repeating ourselves.

Terminal Commands
- Ensure you are always running commands from the project's root directory
- You are allowed to `cd` in to a specific folder but only for executing the command. Always come back to the project's root folder
